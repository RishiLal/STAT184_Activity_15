## What the repo is about
This particular repository is about Activity-15 for my course STAT 184, wherein I have uploaded my activity-14 files, the qmd file and the pdf file, alongside all supporting documents.
This activity can broken apart into 3 distinct codes:
* The first one is **US Military Ranks** - Creating a table that allows one to see the relationship between males and females in the US Army, based on ranks and paygrades.
* The second one is **BabyNames** - Creating a plot on the popularity of certain babynames that I want to track from the 20th to early 21st century.
* The third one is **Volume of Boxplot** - Wherein we visualize via a plot, the maximizing function of a box's volume based on certain dimensions and a cut.

## Where did the data come from?
For the US military code, the data comes from two seperate datasets, one on ranks(link - https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html), and the other on the active-duty personnel(link - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?gid=597536282#gid=597536282).
<br>
The data for the Babynames comes from the babynames dataset from the dcData library.
<br>
There is no pre-existing data for the Volume of the box plot code.
